# Login Mobile App

This is a mobile application that provides a secure and convenient way for users to log in to their accounts. The app is designed to offer a seamless login experience while prioritizing user privacy and data security.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can create new accounts by providing their email address and creating a password. The registration process includes email verification to ensure the authenticity of user accounts.

- **Login**: Registered users can log in to their accounts using their email address and password. The app securely authenticates user credentials and grants access to the account.

- **Forgot Password**: In case users forget their passwords, they can request a password reset. The app sends a password reset link to the user's registered email address, allowing them to create a new password.
